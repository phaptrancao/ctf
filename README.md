  Markdown images have exactly the same formatting as a link, except they’re prefixed with a !
 
## Lists

\* Milk

\* Bread

\* Wholegrain

\* Butter

1. Tidy the kitchen

2. Prepare ingredients

3. Cook delicious things  

Lists are a formatting nightmare in HTML, but Markdown lists are incredibly easy to manage. For a bullet list, just prefix each like with a * - or - or + and they will be converted to dots. You can also create nested lists; just indent a line with 4 spaces and it will be nested under the line above.

  * Milk
  * Bread
      * Wholegrain
  * Butter

For numbered lists, do exactly the same thing - but use numbers!

## Quotes

  \> To be or not to be, that is the question.

When you want to add a quote in Markdown, it’s exactly the same as the formatting which you may already be familiar with from your email app of choice when you reply to someone.

> To be or not to be, that is the question.

Prefixing the line with a > converts it into a block-quote.
